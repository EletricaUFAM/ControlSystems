	        for Windows 9x, ME, NT, 2000 and XP



	********************
	* OPERATING SYSTEM *
	********************

This version of Emu48 should work with all Intel Win32 platforms. You may
recompile the sources to run Emu48 with Windows NT on a DEC Alpha.


	****************
	* INSTALLATION *
	****************

Emu48 is distributed in 1 archive:
- Emu48-1_30.zip		All files and sources

To install Emu48, just unzip Emu48-1_30.zip into an empty directory. When you
first run Emu48, it will detect the directory in which you installed it, and
will write its configuration to a file named Emu48.ini in your Windows
directory. If you move the Emu48 directory to another place you have to change
the directory path inside the Emu48.ini file manually or have to delete the
Emu48.ini file.

You can also update your current version with the Unofficial Service Packs:
- E48BP3x.ZIP			New EXE-File
- E48SP3x.ZIP			Sources of the Service Pack

Replace the original EXE file please.


	************************
	* YOU NEED A ROM IMAGE *
	************************

Emu48 needs an image of a calculator ROM to be able to run. Since fall 2000 the
emulator ROM's for the HP38, 39, 40, 48 and 49 are freely available on different
internet sites. Because there's no license for the distribution of the ROM
images, they aren't included in the Emu48 package. You can still use the classic
way extracting them from your own calculator. But in mostly all cases you have
to convert the ROM files into the Emu48 ROM format.

- HP38:
To upload the ROM of your HP38G, you will need a special aplet called "ROM
UPLOAD", available at http://www.epita.fr/~avenar_j/hp. Once you've uploaded the
ROM, you have to convert it using the Convert utility.

To do that, start a Command Prompt while running Windows, and type:
	Convert <rom-file> ROM.38G

Where <rom-file> is the path to your ROM image. This will create a file named
ROM.38G. This tool will also check its validity.

- HP39/40:
To upload the ROM of your HP39G/HP40G, you will need a special aplet called "ROM
UPLOAD", available at http://privat.swol.de/ChristophGiesselink/emu48.htm. Once
you've uploaded the ROM, you have to convert it using the Rom2emu utility.

To do that, start a Command Prompt while running Windows, and type:
	Rom2emu <rom-file> ROM.39G

There's also a HP39G/HP40G beta ROM for emulators at
http://www.epita.fr/~avenar_j/hp/39.htm for download.

- HP48:
If you have already used another HP48 emulator, you can convert the ROM using
the Convert utility.

To do that, start a Command Prompt while running Windows, and type:
	Convert <rom-file> ROM.48G
or	Convert <rom-file> ROM.48S

Where <rom-file> is the path to your old ROM image. This will create a file
named ROM.48G or ROM.48S, depending on the version you own. This tool should be
able to read any style of ROM image, and will also check its validity. Note that
if you run it with only one parameter, no file will be written, but it will
still check the validity of the ROM.

If you have never used an HP48 emulator, and don't have a ROM dump, you can
either use Jean-Yves Avenard's ROMUPL.BIN or the ROMDump Wizard V1.x, which will
almost automatically get the ROM from your HP48. After the download you may have
to convert your dump with the CONVERT utility into the Emu48 format.

You can find the latest version of the ROM dump programs on:
ROMUPL.BIN	http://www.epita.fr/~avenar_j/hp/calcen.html
ROMDump Wizard	http://privat.swol.de/ChristophGiesselink/index.htm

- HP49:
There's no ROM download program available so far. But you can find a HP49G ROM
for emulators in the YorkeM emulator package or in the HP49G SDK on
http://www.hpcalc.org in the HP49 section.


	****************
	* HOW TO START *
	****************

When Emu48 is installed and you have put the ROM image(s), which must be in the
Emu48 ROM format, into the Emu48 directory, you can start Emu48. You'll see a
"Choose Your KML Script" box.

KML Scripts in fact define the visual aspect of Emu48, the behavior of the
buttons, of the keyboard, ... It's a GREAT way to customize your copy of Emu48.

Check that the path in the "Emu48 Directory" text area is correct. Modify it if
the directory in which you installed Emu48 is not the directory displayed. Click
the refresh button ("V") after modifying it to update the list box or use the
("...") button to start the directory browser.

Choose a KML script in the list box for your calculator ROM you put into Emu48's
directory.

Several HP48 scripts are included in the Emu48 archive:
    * Emu48's Default Faceplate for HP48G/GX
    * Emu48's Default Faceplate for HP48S/SX
	These two are simple scripts, good for 800x600 display resolution.
    * Casey's Gx with Toolbar and Touch Screen
    * Casey's Sx with Toolbar and Touch Screen
	These script uses many advanced features, and is a good demonstration of
	the power of Emu48's scripting language KML. Try it, it is really great!
    * Floating buttons
	This one looks really great.
    * Small but realistic HP48 Gx
	This one has been designed for small resolutions such as 640x480.
	Note: some things in this script have to be fixed.

If you want other great scripts, visit Rechlin's great HP archive
	http://www.hpcalc.org/

And if you are interested in writing new scripts, get the KML 2.0 documentation
from Christoph's page at http://privat.swol.de/ChristophGiesselink/emu48.htm

Once you have selected a script, press OK to start the emulator. In most cases,
when Emu48 crash after pressing the OK button, you forgot to convert the ROM
image into the emulator format. While it's running, you can use the View/Change
KML Script... command to change the visual aspect of Emu48.


	***************
	* KML SCRIPTS *
	***************

Don't use TRUELCD.KMI for emulating display contrast in your scripts. It's not
fully correct. The hardware contrast values are in the area from 0 to 31. But
the ROMs bounds them to useful values. The HP48 S(X) ROM use only display
contrast values between 3 and 19 and the HP48 G(X) ROM values between 9 and 24.

Maybe you have to adjust the "Rom" filename in the "Global" section. This mostly
happen with the HP49G ROM name. Some KML files use the name ROM.E49, that's the
name of the emulator ROM file published by HP. But Emu48 state files for the
HP49G have the same file extension, so the use of ROM.49G is preferred now.


	****************
	* COMMAND LINE *
	****************

The command line syntax is "Emu48 [E48file [Port2file]]". The first parameter
sets the filename for the emulation data, the second parameter the Port2 file.
You're not able to set a Port 2 file without setting the emulation data file.
The arguments are optional.


	*******************
	* LOAD/SAVE FILES *
	*******************

There are two ways to transfer files from or to the emulator. The one way is to
use the serial port to transfer the data directly from your HP to the emulator.
The second way is to load data, saved on your PC, into the stack of the
emulator. You can do this by using the Edit/Load Object... command or with the
file Drag and Drop feature. But there's one important restriction, the data must
a HP binary file (begin with HPHP48- or HPHP49-, this depends on your emulated
calculator)! If not, the data is load as string. The Edit/Save Object... command
will save the data in stack level 1 on the PC (always binary mode). Be sure,
when you use the second way for data transfer, that no program is running on the
emulator. The second way doesn't work on a HP38, because he has no stack. So you
can load aplets only from the serial port.


	*****************
	* DRAG AND DROP *
	*****************

Dropping HP objects over the emulator window will load program files (like the
command "Load object...") on the stack. Be sure that the emulator isn't busy
before doing this.


	*******************
	* SHARED RAM CARD *
	*******************

You can add a SHARED (explained below) RAM card of up to 4MB to a HP48. By
default, no such card will be created when you start Emu48. The MkShared.exe
utility will allow you to create it.

To create a Port 2 RAM Card, call the program, select the RAM Card size, enter
the card file name and press the 'Create' button. That's it. Please remember,
this program replace the destination file without any request!

If you use RAM cards greater than 128 KB in a HP48SX, you can only see the first
128 KB of the card. Please remember, the firmware of all HP48GX versions has a
bug when using a 4MB RAM card. You always get the message "Warning: Invalid Card
Data" at startup and Port 33 is unaccessible. This is not a bug of the emulator!

When you have created this file, run Emu48, and use the Close menu item to close
the calculator state. Now select File/Settings. In the "Port 2" text area, type
the name of the file you created (if you don't include a path, it will be
searched for in Emu48's directory).

You can also tick the check box "Port 2 Is Shared". When the box is cleared,
only the first instance of Emu48 will allow you to use the RAM card in Port 2.
When this box is checked, the first instance of Emu48 will give you both read
and write access to this RAM card. If you start Emu48 in another instance, the
RAM card in Port 2 will be write-protected. Thus you can transfer files very
easily between two calculators. This RAM card is used by both S/SX and G/GX
types.


	***********************
	* FLASH ROM EMULATION *
	***********************

The HP49G save the operation system in a reprogramable memory, a so called flash
memory. The flash memory is divided into two parts, into the Operating System
and into a User Data area. The User Data area is viewed as Port 2 in the HP49G.
Emu48 saves the Port 2 data in the ROM file (normally ROM.49G). As default
setting the ROM file is writeable in the first instance of Emu48. When you open
another instance of a HP49G emulation the Port 2 area is READ ONLY, that mean
all changes in Port 2 are lost when you exit this instance. If you don't want to
save data in Port 2 and want to protect the operating systems from overwriting,
you're able protect the ROM file. To do this, close all Emu48 instances and set
the variable 'Writeable' defined in the Emu48.ini file, section [ROM] to zero.


	***********************
	* COPY / PASTE STRING *
	***********************

With the menu items "Copy String" and "Paste String" in the "Edit" menu you're
able to copy HP string objects from the stack to the PC clipboard and vice
versa.


	**********
	* BACKUP *
	**********

Emu48 includes a backup feature (in the Edit menu). It save the complete state
of the calculator (excepting the ROM and Port 2 content) in the computer's
memory. You might want to use it before doing something risky, and if you don't
want to save to the disk. It provides some kind of Undo feature. It is also used
by Emu48 when you want to save or load a new document, to restore its old state
if you cancel the operation or of something goes wrong.


	************
	* KEYBOARD *
	************

To enter a character to the emulator use the PC keyboard (key translation
depends on the used KML script) or the mouse. If you press the left mouse
button, the emulator key is pressed as long as you press the mouse button or
leaving the area of the emulator button. Sometimes you need to press more then
one key (contrast setting, warmstart, ...). To do this, press the right mouse
button. All "locked" buttons are released after enter a key with the left mouse
button.


	*********
	* CLOCK *
	*********

The emulator time is synchronized with the PC time at startup of the emulator.
This may cause problems with other non original operating systems running on the
HP. On HP48 S(X) calculators the address area #00052-#00070, on all other
emulated calculators the address area #00058-#00076 in System RAM are rewritten
with the actual time information.


	*************
	* EMU48.INI *
	*************

The section [Timers] in the Emu48.ini file isn't used any more. The variable
values are replaced by useful constants. You may delete this section if you
want. Starting an old version of Emu48 (V1.07 and earlier) will add this section
again. If you move the Emu48 directory to another place, you have to adjust the
variable 'Emu48Directory' in the [Files] section.


	************************
	* REAL SPEED EMULATION *
	************************

As you recognized the speed of the emulated HP is much faster than an original
one. The reason is, the assembler commands are emulated faster than the original
CPU can execute them. On one side this is a big advantage (faster execution of
programs) on the other side this cause many trouble. In Emu48 only the timers
work with the original speed. In result all commands like User-RPL WAIT wait
more or less the correct time. But many programs like shells or editors use an
own key handler to realize an autorepeat implementation. Normally these programs
use the execution time of each assembler command for waiting. On Emu48 this time
is much shorter, so the time between each key read is shorter as well and you
get a very fast key repetition. The editor ED from the JAZZ package hasn't this
problem, because the key input is synchronized with one of the timers. To solve
this problem Emu48 generally slow down emulation if a key is pressed. To solve
some other speed depending problems you are able to slow down the whole
emulation speed. There are two variables 'SXCycles=82' and 'GXCycles=123'
defined in the Emu48.ini file, section [Emulator] which control the "real" speed
and key repetition slow down for each calculator type. Each numeric value is
representing the allowed CPU cycles in a 16384Hz time frame. Because the used
cycle statements (from SASM.DOC) in Emu48 doesn't correspond to the real values
of the CPU, the saved values are estimated by comparing the execution time of a
program to the real calculator. Increasing the value fitting to your ROM will
make the "real speed" HP faster and vice versa. No warranty to the functionality
of Emu48 when you go below the default values.


	*************************
	* SERIAL PORT EMULATION *
	*************************

The serial ports are emulated as well now. You may choose the same serial port
for wire and IR. Remember that the IR port only work with 2400 Baud. If you want
to change the serial port settings, but they are disabled, close the serial port
with the command CLOSEIO or power cycle the HP first.

Now it's possible to make transfers between the real calculator and Emu48. If
you have problems with the connection please try the following. There's a simple
way to check if your serial port is used by another program. First disable the
serial settings in both combo boxes and very important close the settings
dialog. Reopen the settings dialog and choose the COM port in the wire combo box
to the port the HP is connected with. When you open this combo box you only see
valid (unused) serial ports. Don't use the IR combo box, it only works with 2400
Baud. The next important thing are the serial settings of the real calculator
and Emu48, they must be equal. If this doesn't work then mostly there's a
hardware or a resource problem of the serial port. Check this with connecting
the HP with a transfer program you like on the same serial port.


	****************
	* DISASSEMBLER *
	****************

With the internal disassembler you're able to disassemble the Saturn chip
address area. With the default Map setting the disassembler always see the
mapped memory address. If for example you configured the RAM at #00000 you will
see the RAM and not the ROM at this address. With the other module settings you
specify a special module for disassembly. Each module use a linear address mode,
beginning at address #00000 and will not overlapped by other modules. So, for
example, you can access the second port of a HP48 RAM card greater than 128KB at
address #40000 (128 * 1024 * 2). The "Copy Data" button copies the selected
disassembler lines to the PC clipboard.


	**************
	* DDE SERVER *
	**************

I implemented a DDE server in Emu48 to transmit data from and to the HP stack
with DDE. You have the same restrictions like with the commands "Load object..."
and "Save Object...", that a running program may corrupt memory. Take care to
transmit data only after the acknowledge of the last DDE transaction.

Technical data:

Servername:      Emu48
Topicname:       Stack
Item:            - (ignored, must be a nonzero string)
Clipboardformat: "CF_HPOBJ" (user defined)

The DDE commands CONNECT, POKE and REQUEST are supported.

The structure of the clipboard format "CF_HPOBJ":

+--------+------------------------------------+
| 4 Byte |             HP object              |
+--------+------------------------------------+
    \        \
     \        +--- normal HP object
      +----------- length of object (LSB first)
